##### [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) extension to help you focus while coding

_Inspired by [Noisli](https://www.noisli.com/) and [Relax](http://brunobord.github.io/relax/)_

##### Current version: v0.9.6

## About the project

First of all, I love [Noisli](https://www.noisli.com/) because it works
brilliantly for me. Although I never used all of its features, such as the text
editor or even some of its sounds. I'd always leave it on playing in the
background while doing some work. When it comes to portability, it has
limitations, though, and I also don't like to rely on the browser nor the
internet connection in this matter.

Then there is [Relax](http://brunobord.github.io/relax/), a great alternative
to Noisli, which I discovered not long before I started to implement InFocus,
that offers the option of being portable, but again, I don't do actual work
inside it.

So here's my minimalistic distillation of a similar tool in the form of an
extension for my [favourite editor](http://brackets.io/). It lives where the work happens, therefore,
can be controlled conveniently. That also means you can use it on the go, or
basically anywhere.

I've included ten different sounds in it, which I call channels. Namely:
**dawn**, **garden**, **summer night**, **frog pond**, **wind**, **fire**,
**water**/**river**, **snow** + **light rain**, **cityscape** and **cafe**.

Certainly, for the best experience, I would suggest using headphones,
especially for those delicate sounds such as the _snow falling_ (which is one of
my favourites by the way).

Please note, that since InFocus uses sound files, it is significantly larger
than the rest of the available extensions. Even though I tried to optimise the
sounds on the balance of quality and file size, we are talking approximately
**42MBs** here.
I find the following compression just enough for the purpose:
_44.1kHz 24bit STEREO VBR OGG_.

Just be aware, it may take longer to download, etc.

## Install

1. `File` >> `Extension Manager` >> `Available` tab
2. Search for `InFocus`
3. Click on `Install`

## Usage

Use the keyboard shortcut `CTRL` + `ALT` + `.` _(period)_ to toggle the panel.
Or go to: `Navigate` >> `InFocus`.

Click on the icon of the desired sound, and it will start playing.
You can play any number of sounds at once.

Use the slider or the mute button to control the overall volume.

## Resources

#### Used sounds:
All the sounds come from [freesound.org](https://www.freesound.org), see the
sources and the licences linked below. Also, all of the sounds have been
slightly edited by me, e.g. they have been cut, made loopable, compressed and
re-titled for the extension.

The following sounds are the amazing field recordings of **Tim Kahn** aka [**Corsica_S**](https://www.freesound.org/people/Corsica_S/):
